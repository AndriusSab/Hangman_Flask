This Hangman game allows players to guess a secret word letter by letter. 
The game provides a user interface where players can interact with the game and make their guesses. 
After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the secret word or not. 
Players continue guessing until they either solve the word or run out of attempts.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Interactive gameplay for guessing letters

- Display of game results (wins and losses) for registered players
- SQLite database for storing player information and game results
